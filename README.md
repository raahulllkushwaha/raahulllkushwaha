Hi, I’m Rahul Kushwaha 👋

🎓 MCA Student | 💻 Java Backend Developer | ⚙️ Microservices & DevOps Enthusiast

I’m a backend-focused developer with a strong foundation in Java and Spring Boot, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA). I enjoy building scalable, logic-driven systems and continuously improving my understanding of distributed systems, microservices architecture, and modern DevOps practices.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and understanding why a system works, not just how to make it run.
